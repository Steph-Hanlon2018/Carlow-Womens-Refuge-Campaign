# Carlow-Womens-Refuge-Campaign
We currently have no Women's refuge in Carlow. Our aim is to create awareness at local level of the pressure that is put on the frontline services in Carlow, to request additional funding and resources that are already there, and to highlight the need for a women's refuge. This is in tandem with with our calls for adequate funding for domestic violence services in the coming election at local and national level.The Council have responded to our calls and given the green light to funding a 6 bedroom house. This is compared to the refuge in Kilkenny which has a capacity of 55 people.  This campaign calls the Council to provide a more suitable location to meet the needs and the size of the constituency.
